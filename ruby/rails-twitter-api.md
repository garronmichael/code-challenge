# StackCommerce Rails Twitter API Challenge

## Goals

This challenge is designed to test your skills with:

* Ruby on Rails
* Consuming RESTful APIs
* Git
* Cloud Deployments

This challenge generally takes candidates no more than 2 hours to complete.

## Requirements

1. Setup a public GitHub repository to host the code.
1. Create a Rails 4.1+ application
  1. Create an authentication layer to protect access from the general public.
  1. Consume the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api) to display the time & content of the last 25 tweets for any given Twitter handle.
1. Deploy the application to Heroku (free app/tier).

### Bonus Points

* Writing specs/tests!
* Caching identical API calls for ~5 mins to avoid hammering the Twitter API.
* Parsing `@mentions` in tweets and linking to the status pages for those.
* Anything else cool that you can think of.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a Readme file within the repository that contains the following: 
  1. Local environment setup instructions
  1. Basic Heroku deployment instructions
  1. Test suite setup/execution instructions (if applicable) 
1. Email links to your **public GitHub** repo and **live Heroku** application to [devs@stacksocial.com](mailto:devs@stacksocial.com)
